* Reconstructed the intermediate function to match Dataiku inference flow.
* Successfully read inference scope files for both CA and US regions.
* Loaded and validated population data for model input preparation.
* Read and structured model paths based on region and model type.
* Handled reading of both LightGBM and Linear Regression models; resolved format issues.
* Implemented logic to load all models in batch, replicating Dataiku’s model management.
* Executed batch predictions for all models and concatenated the results into a unified inference output.
* Initiated model preprocessing logic; began handling categorical variables (some challenges remain).
* Began extending evaluation metrics (AUC, loss) to support validation consistency—though not critical for inference, adds transparency.
* Identified issues:

  * Missing transformation modules used in Dataiku pipeline.
  * Challenges in variable feeding into the preprocessing pipeline.
